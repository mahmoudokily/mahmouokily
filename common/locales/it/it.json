    "description": "Today, the need to obtain what we want comes before the desire itself: we live in the here and now, in the all and now and in the era of the blue tick. \n\n We need to rediscover the ability to think in the long term, to think of a human project, initially in terms of ethics and culture and then in terms of politics and economics, which can outline the characteristics of a new type of society. \n\n This society can unite the liberal meta-project in favor of individual projects with a guiding framework on the kind of society we would like to build together and the social meaning of living together as a community. \n\n We should not be subjected to technological progress but manage it according to participatory and conscious governance of innovation in order to solve the massive cultural, social, environmental, and economic issues. \n\n The Internet has gone from being a tool of freedom to a tool of surveillance, with our data as the end product. \n\n To reverse this alarming trend, we have decentralized and opened up the network that allows us to restore autonomy, privacy, and security.\n\n Our way of life is changing, and so are the cities we live in: they are becoming green, digital, responsive, and placing technology at the service of man.  \n\n In this context, art plays a key role in the rebirth of our society. \n\n Thanks to it, three key characteristics can be fostered: sociability, activity, and \n\n Art is a kind of training ground in which individuals and communities can experiment and search for their own authenticity and global perspective.\n\n The function of art is to be a mouthpiece for change, intercepting the future and outlining innovative trajectories and scenarios in such a way as to foreshadow a new vision of the world to be incorporated into the present to act in a conscious and participatory manner towards the design of a better future.  \n\n Art must be like an enzyme that activates innovative processes and contaminates our lives. \n\n In such a delicate historical moment like the one we are living in, there is need for a cultural revolution to bring about human evolution.",
    "subtitle": "The historical moment in which we live confronts us with the need to investigate the potential and critical aspects of the use of new technologies, so as not to be subjected to them and instead give life to a conscious and participatory 'governance of innovation'. Reasoned Art was created with this aim in mind: to propose an innovative vision of the present through art's ability to intercept the future.",
